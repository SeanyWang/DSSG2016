<p>
I am a graduate student in Information Systems at Boston University, with a concentration in Data Analytics. I received my Bachelor's from Emory University in Atlanta, GA. After graduating I worked as an IT Consultant with Oracle for their knowledge management and enterprise search software.</p>
<p>
This summer, I look forward to learning more about the intersection of Social Sciences and Data Science. I also look forward to further developing my background in Text Mining and Machine Learning, which our project, Unsafe Foods, focuses on. I also hope to become more proficient in Python. As far as this program specifically has to offer, I am very excited to spend ten weeks in the beautiful city of Seattle, visit Olympic National Park, and spend my time in the pleasant confines of the UW eScience Institute!

<p>The first week was packed with highly useful tutorials. I strongly recommend that interested individuals sign up for a Software Carpentry workshop near them. It is very helpful in providing an introduction to working with object-oriented programming languages with a focus on Data Analytics, and the intro to version control with Git is very useful as well.</p>

<p>I look forward to continuing to work with my awesome team this summer to develop personally, academically, and in my career. It will be a wonderful opportunity to work with experienced mentors, accomplished fellows, and ample resources to hopefully provide a Data Science solution for the betterment of others.</p>
