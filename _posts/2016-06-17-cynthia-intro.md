##About Me

<p>
I am a graduate student at Boston University in Information Systems with a concentration in Data Analytics, and I am so excited to be here in Seattle with the Data Science for Social Good fellowship program and on the Unsafe Foods project. I previously worked for Oracle as an IT consultant for search engine and knowledge management software. I am very interested in the topics of text mining and machine learning.

<p>
I was born in Houston, TX, and I then moved to Atlanta, GA, where I received my Bachelor's from Emory University.

In my spare time, I love to play piano, read, and swim.
