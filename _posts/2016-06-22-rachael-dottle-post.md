title:  "Introducing DSSG Fellow Rachael Dottle"

<p/>My name is Rachael, and I am one of four fellows working on investigating alternatives to census data as a means to estimate the spatial distribution of poverty on the Crowdsensing Census project in the Data Science for Social Good program at UW.

<p/>I am currently a graduate student in the Quantitative Methods for Social Science Research program at Columbia University in New York, concentrating in Data Science. I recently completed an interdisciplinary bachelor's degree in urban studies at Barnard College of Columbia University with special focuses in GIS, social stats, and architecture.

<p/>My research surrounds the intersection of data science and urban planning, with a focus on the ways that digital technologies restructure urban spatial patterns, and the construction of social and political space. Oh, and I make a lot of maps in the process.

<p/>I am participating in DSSG because the program offers an opportunity to work on meaningful projects that combine data and urbanism within a social-minded context. I hope to gain additional experience working on data science projects in a team setting, and to learn some new data visualization techniques.

<p/>These past two weeks, I've enjoyed getting to know the other fellows, and beginning to explore Seattle. I'm a bit biased when it comes to cities and was a little apprehensive at first about leaving NYC...but, so far, so good. I'm getting used to the overwhelming amount of greenery, and have had some great coffee. Not convinced that I'll find a good bagel, but that's okay.
