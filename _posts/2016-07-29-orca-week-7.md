As discussed in our previous ![post](https://uwescience.github.io/DSSG2016//2016/07/05/orca-week-3.html), there are three main forms of potential bias which could limit ORCA data's usefulness in informing transit planning: 1) ORCA vs. APC (automatic passenger count)/ridership. If some routes/time/stops has a higher percentage of passengers using ORCA card, then those routes/time/stops could be more influential when ORCA card are used for planning purposes 2) APC vs. ridership, due to the fact that only a proportion of King County Metro buses have APC counts. If some routes/stops have a higher percentage of journeys with APC counts, then those routes/stops would be more influential when APC is used for planning purposes 3) ridership vs. population of puget sound. If some communities currently have more bus usage, those communities are more likely to be overrepresented in our data, thus have a higher weight in planning decisions. For equity purposes, the ORCA team would like to understand those three bias, thus qualifying the usefulness of planning based on ORCA data. 

### Bias #1 ORCA vs. APC/Ridership

In the past 1+ weeks, our group has been actively working on data preparation work in merger ORCA tap data with APC data in an attempt to address bias #1. Those attempts will be described in detail in a blogpost later.

One of the progress towards comparing ORCA to APC/Ridership is to spatially aggregate ORCA data to the census tract in order to compare with for instance, ridership estimates from the American Community Survey. 

For instance, below is a graph illustrating the percentage of workers within each census tract reporting taking public transportation to go to work.

### Bias #2 APC vs. ridership

Since for King County Metro  only a proportion of the buses have APC counts, in order to be able to use APC as our ground truth, we need to first understand whether APC are representatively sampled across space and time. From talking to project lead and transit agencies, we learned that APC sensors, which are attached to buses themselves, are never moved. Instead, buses with sensors are dispatched on different routes in an effort to get ridership estimates for all routes for the transit agencies. We also learned that this strategic dispatch happens mostly during weekdays, and less so for weekends. Equipped with that knowledge. We first analyzed the percentage of journeys with APC all routes. On average 30.41% of the journeys on weekdays have APC counts, and 30.94% of the journeys on weekends have APC counts, this is higher than we originally expect.

Due to the fact that some routes have vastly more journeys than other routes, we calculated the percentage of journeys with APC for each route. Ten routes with the most and least percentage of journeys with APC are shown in the figure. As can be observed from the graph, KCM routes with the highest percentage of the journeys with APC data are the Sound Transit routes, the rapid ride lines (all rapid rides have high percentage of journeys with APC, didn't plot them all on the map to avoid overplotting), and the KCM routes closer to the northern base. And KCM routes with the lowest percentage of journeys with APC counts are school buses (not plotted), temporary buses, and buses closer to the southern base.

A similar pattens emerge. Rapid rides and buses leaving from the north base have high percentage of journeys with APC, while buses leaving from the south base have lower percentage of journeys with APC.

Is APC count representatively sampling journeys across routes? The above analysis suggest that the answer is no. While some routes have over 80% of the journeys with APC data, others have as low as 3% through our 9 weeks of data recording. The factors that is contributing the most seem to be the type of bus (whether rapid ride etc.), the transit agency (whether Sound Transit), as well as the base where the bus departs from (norther basis seem to have higher % of journeys with APC count data). 

As newer buses on average are more likely to have APC devices, this patten also implies that regular buses (not including rapid rides and sound transit)operating in northern Seattle area tend to be newer than those running towards the south, which points to directions for bus updating and transit planning.

###Bias #3 Ridership vs. Population of Puget Sound

While our data could not directly address the 

These past two weeks have probably introduced more questions than answers but these puzzles have also allowed us to learn new skills, methods, and ways of interacting with large data sets. We have been challenged to come up with creative paths forward when things did not turn out the way we initially anticipated and we are excited to see what surprises the data have in store for us in the future!
