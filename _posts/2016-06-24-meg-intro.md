![Meg]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/MegAtacama.jpg){:width="200px" align="right" style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5px;"} I am a PhD student in Human-Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington. My primary my research concentration is visual analytics, and I am also involved with ethnographic work at the eScience Institute.

I am excited to expand both my programming and social science skills in the DSSG program and to contribute to a project with the potential to immediately impact the community.  The DSSG model is closely aligned with my values for engaging community stakeholders in the data analysis process, facilitating their understanding of information of and ability to tell their own stories.
