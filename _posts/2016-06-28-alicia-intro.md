I am a PhD Candidate in Psychology here at UW with a minor in quantitative science. My general research interest is in bias in person perception, with my dissertation focusing on the intersectionality between multiple forms of discrimination and bias (e.g. age, gender and race). 

I am very excited to be one of the four fellows on the ORCA team in the DSSG program this summer. I am especially excited about learning geospatial analysis, as well as providing insights and solutions to real world problems. 

In my spare time, I enjoy taking full advantage of the beautiful natural surrounding of the greater Seattle area. I am looking forward to exploring the area more with my fellow DSSG fellows.
