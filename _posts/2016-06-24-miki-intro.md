I am an undergraduate student at the University of Washington in the Applied and Computational Math Sciences Program with a focus in Discrete Math and Algorithms. I am most interested in data-driven modelling, data visualization, and machine learning. 

This summer, I will be working on the *Mining Online Data for Early Identification of Unsafe Food Products*
project. I already learned a great deal in the tutorial-filled first week, and I especially enjoyed working with GIS, which I had never had any exposure to before. I am looking forward to learning more about text mining and machine learning during the course of the fellowship, as well as gaining experience working with a team on a large scale problem.
