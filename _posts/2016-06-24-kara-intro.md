style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 5px;"> I am a master's student in
library and information science at UW where I focus on data management,
curation, and visualization. My undergraduate background is in environmental
science, and before starting the MLIS program I worked as a data manager on
research projects dealing with lake ecology and climate change. I'm excited to
approach research with a more explicitly human-centered perspective this summer.

As a DSSG fellow I'll be working on the project "Mining Online Data for Early
Identification of Unsafe Food Products". I'm really looking forward to learning
more about text mining and branching out from R, which I've used happily for
several years, to Python. Thanks to the tutorials of last week I'm already
successfully writing Python code. I also hope to contribute some interactive
visualizations to our project.
