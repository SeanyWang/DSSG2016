```ruby
myself = DSSG2016Participant.initialize("Kaicheng Tan")
myself.assignedProject = "Global Open Sidewalk"
myself.major = "Computer Science"
```

I am an undergraduate in Computer Science at University of Washington, 
WA. I am interested in data science and want to work in this field after
graduating. Therefore, the DSSG program becomes a valuable opportunity
for me to gain some experience on data science programming, and to learn
how to collaborate with other scientists in this field.

My assigned project is Global Open Sidewalk, where I learned a lot on how to
outline a new project over the week. I worked on AccessMap project last
Spring quarter, which helps me to have a better understanding on what
this project is about and what my role in this project is. On the other 
hand, everyone in this program seems professional and skillful, which gives
me some stress and pushes me to continue learning.

I am very excited to work on this project, and I wish everyone could get
what they want from this project at the end :)
