I am a graduate student in Landscape Architecture at the University of Washington where I also work for [Urban@UW](http://urban.uw.edu "Urban@UW").

I am interested in understanding more about the potential role of data in shaping the built environment, specifically as it relates to people, climate and cities. With it's open data policy, engaged citizens and unique relationship with nature I an excited to be exploring these ideas in Seattle.

As a DSSG fellow I'll be working on the OpenSidewalks project. I look forward to expanding my GIS skills and bridging them with interactive design that can facilitate a participatory process, while also exploring the idea of accessibility. 

The first week was full of tutorials. Amongst many other things, I had my first experience with python and was excited to finally have a guided tour through git - something I had played with in the past but never felt comfortable enough to fully utilize.
