Originally from Southern California I relocated to Seattle in the Fall of 2014 to start a PhD program in Sociology at the University of Washington.
My current research focuses on urban environmental inequality and its relationship to racial/ethnic and economic stratification. I'm pursuing several projects 
looking at the relationships between residential mobility/stratification and air pollution. 

I heard about the DSSG fellowship program from a fellow student in my program and was extremely drawn to the prospect of being involved in a 
project that explicitly seeks to better the Seattle area in substantive and community-centered ways. The eScience Instituteâ€™s Data Science for 
the Social Good program combines the skills and theoretical knowledge I came to graduate school to learn with my strong desire to make the world 
a better, more equitable place. I believe this program will provide me with tangible examples of ways to bridge academic research with community 
engagement, which I plan to integrate into the rest of my work throughout my career.

I am particularly interested in learning how to hone my GIS skills to better visualize spatial data. This is going to be especially important for answering
questions about ORCA transit data and I know I will additionally benefit from these skills in my own work on neighborhoods and environmental quality. 
I've already learned quite a bit within the first two weeks of the program including the value and importance of Git and the utility of GitHub as well as
a number of new (to me) features of QGIS.
