title: About Data Science for Social Good
---

The University of Washington eScience Institute in collaboration with
[Urban@UW](http://urban.uw.edu/) and Microsoft presents the 2016
Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) summer program. The program brings together
data and domain scientists to work on focused, collaborative projects that are
designed to impact public policy for social benefit.

The program is modeled after similar programs at the [University of Chicago and](http://dssg.io/) and at [Georgia Tech](http://dssg-atl.io/), with elements
from our own [Data Science Incubator](http://escience.washington.edu/get-involved/incubator-programs/):
sixteen DSSG Student Fellows are working with academic researchers, data
scientists, and public stakeholder groups on data-intensive research projects.

This year's [projects]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/projects.html) focus on
Urban Science, aiming to understand and extract valuable, actionable information
out of data from urban environments across topic areas including public health,
sustainable urban planning, crime prevention, education, transportation, and
social justice. Click
